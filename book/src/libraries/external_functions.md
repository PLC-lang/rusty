# External Functions

A `POU` (`PROGRAM`, `FUNCTION`, `FUNCTION_BLOCK`) can be marked as external,
which will cause the compiler to ignore its implementation.

```iecst
{external}
FUNCTION log : DINT
VAR_IN_OUT
  message : STRING[1024];
END_VAR
VAR_INPUT
  type : (Err,Warn,Info) := Info;
END_VAR
END_FUNCTION
```

At compilation time, the function `log` will be defined as an externally available function, and can be called from `ST` code.

> Note : At linking time, a `log` function with a compatible signature must be available on the system.

## Calling C functions

`ST` code can call into foreign functions natively.
To achieve this, the called function must be defined in a `C` compatible API, e.g. `extern "C"` blocks.

The interface of the function has to :

- either be included with the `-i` flag
- or be declared in `ST` using the `{external}` keyword

### Example

Given a `min` function defined in `C` as follows :

```C
int min(int a, int b) {
//...
}
```

an interface of that function in `ST` can be defined as :

```iecst
{external}
FUNCTION min : DINT
VAR_INPUT
  a : DINT;
  b : DINT;
END_VAR
END_FUNCTION
```

### Variadic arguments

Some foreign functions, especially ones defined in `C`, could be [variadic functions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/variadic).

These functions are usually defined with the last parameter `...`, and signify that a function can be called with unlimited parameters.

An example of a variadic function is `printf`.

Calling a variadic function is supported in `ST`. To mark an external function as variadic, you can add a parameter of type `...` to the `VAR_INPUT` block.

#### Variadic function example

Given the `printf` function defined as :

```C
int printf( const char *restrict format, ... );
```

the `ST` interface can be defined as :

```iecst
{external}
FUNCTION printf : DINT
VAR_INPUT {ref}
  format : STRING;
END_VAR
VAR_INPUT
  args : ...;
END_VAR
END_FUNCTION
```

#### Runnable example

With the `printf` function available on the system, there is no need to declare
the C function.

An `ST` program called `ExternalFunctions.st` with the following code can be declared :

```iecst
(*ExternalFunctions.st*)

(**
 * The printf function's interface, marked as external since 
 * it is defined directly along other ST functions
 *)
{external}
FUNCTION printf : DINT
VAR_INPUT {ref}
    format : STRING;
END_VAR
VAR_INPUT
    args: ...;
END_VAR
END_FUNCTION


(**
* The main function of the program prints a demo to the standard out
* The function main is implemented at this location and thus not marked
* as {external}
*)
FUNCTION main : DINT
VAR
    tmp : DINT;
END_VAR
  tmp := 1;
  printf('Value %d, %d, %d$N', tmp, tmp * 10, tmp * 100);
  main := tmp;
END_FUNCTION
```

Compiling the previous code with the following command :

```sh
rustyc ExternalFunctions.st -o ExternalFunctions --linker=clang
```

will yield an executable called `ExternalFunctions`.

> We use clang to link the generated object file and generate an executable
> since the embedded linker cannot generate executable files.

The executable can then be started with `./ExternalFunctions`.
