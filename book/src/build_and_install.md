# Building and Installing

## Prerequisites
To be able to build the source code, you will need to [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
and LLVM 11 along with the standard build tools (`build-essential`) and `libz-dev` on your machine. 
For Linux the package manager version of LLVM (`llvm-11-dev` for apt) will work fine, for Windows, you need a
[special build](https://github.com/ghaith/llvm-package-windows/releases/tag/v11.0.1). If you want to
clone and work on the repository, you'll also need _git_.

## Cloning the repository
On your local computer, open up a shell and clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghaith/rusty
cd rusty
```

## Building
Building is as easy as typing a single command. If you just want to use the
compiler without doing development, building the release configuration will
give you a smaller and likely a faster binary.
```bash
cargo build --release
```

You can find the binary at `./target/release/rustyc`.

## Installing
_TODO_
