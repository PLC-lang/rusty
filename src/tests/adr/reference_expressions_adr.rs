/// # Architecture Design Records: Representation of Reference Expressions
///
/// Reference Experssions are expressions that reference variables, POUs,
/// datatypes, etc. There are traditional references that point to a value of
/// a local (`i`), global (`PI`), or even a member-variable (`point.x`). Furthermore
/// there are reference-expressions that point to an element of an array (`x[3]`),
/// dereference a pointer (`pNext^`) or references that access the address of a variable
/// (`&next`).
///
/// There is only one AST-Statement-Variant representing all different kinds of references. It
/// contains an access-member which represents the different kinds of accessing an element:
/// ReferenceExpression
/// - Member-Access (accessing a member of a struct, pou, etc.)
/// - Index-Access (accessing an element of an array)
/// - Casting a value
/// - Dereferencing a pointer
/// - accessing the Address of a variable

/// A flat reference is treated as a Qualified-Reference with no qualifier.
/// This means that a flat reference (a) and a qualified reference (a.b)
/// are represented using the same AST-Structure. One has no qualifier (None),
/// the other one has.

/// a Member-Access. Note that the sequence of the reference elements
/// (obj, position, x) is actually stored in reverse order in the recursive
