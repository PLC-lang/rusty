//! Validation functions for interface polymorphism, called during lowering.
//!
//! Each function returns `Some(Diagnostic)` when the code is invalid, or `None` when valid.
//!
//! Note:
//! These checks run inside [`super::interface::InterfaceDispatchLowerer`] rather than in the
//! normal validation pass because the lowerer rewrites interface types to `__FATPOINTER` before
//! the validator sees them. Running these checks here ensures error messages reference the
//! user-written interface names, not internal types.
//!
//! Technically a `pre_generate` exists, which would mean polymorphic lowering happens after validation but
//! other lowerers would then also need to change hooking from `post_annotate` to `pre_generate` and also
//! break existing validations (some SUPER tests failed when I tried this). As a result, doing validations
//! during lowering is the most pragmatic option right now, even if it's a bit inelegant.
