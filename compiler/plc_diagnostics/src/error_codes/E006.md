# Missing Token

During the parsing phase, an additional _Token_ (Element) was required to correctly interpret the code.
The error message usually indicates what Token was missing.

## Example
In the following example the name (Identifier) of the program is missing.
```iecst
PROGRAM (*name*)
END_PROGRAM
```

```
error: Unexpected token: expected Identifier but found END_PROGRAM
  ┌─ example.st:2:1
  │
2 │ END_PROGRAM
  │ ^^^^^^^^^^^ Unexpected token: expected Identifier but found END_PROGRAM
```
