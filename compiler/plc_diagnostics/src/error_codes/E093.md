# Invalid Conditional Value

Control statements such as `IF`, `FOR` and `WHILE` require specific types for their condition.

## If, While

`IF` and `WHILE` statements require an expression which yields a boolean, any other type is invalid and will trigger an
error.

# For

`FOR` statements require four conditional values: a `counter`, a `start` value, an `end` value and a `step` value. All
of these need to be integers and share the same type.

```iecst
FOR start := counter TO end BY step DO
// ...
END_FOR
```
