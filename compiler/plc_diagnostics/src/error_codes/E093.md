# Conditional Loop Values

Any conditional value used in a for-loop, i.e. the counter, start, end and step-value must be of the same numerical
type.
If for example the counter is of type DINT, then any other conditional value also has to be of type DINT.

## Why?

For one because the norm defines the given behavior but also because it can be useful to avoid endless-loop in case of
overflows. This can happen if for example you have a start value of type SINT and an end value of type DINT where the
DINT value is bigger than the maximal SINT value (= 127).

```iecstd
    VAR
        idx : SINT := 0;
        end : DINT := 255;
    END_VAR
    
    FOR idx := 0 TO end DO
        // the `end` condition will never be reached because `idx` will overflow once it reaches a value of 128
    END_FOR
```
