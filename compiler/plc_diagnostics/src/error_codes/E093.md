# Invalid Conditional Value

Control statements such as `if`, `for` and `while` require specific types for their condition.

## If, While

`if` and `while` statements require an expression which yields a boolean, any other type is invalid and will trigger an
error.

# For

`FOR` statements require four conditional values: a `counter`, a `start` value, an `end` value and a `step` value. All of these need to be integers and share the same type.

```iecst
FOR start := counter TO end BY step DO
// ...
END_FOR
```
