# Invalid Conditional Value

Control statements such as `if`, `for` and `while` require specific types for their condition.

## If, While

`if` and `while` statements require an expression which yields a boolean, any other type is invalid and will trigger an
error.

# For

`for` statements have four conditional values namely a counter, start, end and step all of which have to be a numerical
value (but not real).

```iecst
FOR start := counter TO end BY step DO
// ...
END_FOR
```
