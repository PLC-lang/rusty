# Config Variable With Incomplete Address

Variables defined in a `VAR_CONFIG` block, i.e. config variables, must specify a complete address.

Erroneous code example:
```iecst
VAR_CONFIG
    main.foo.bar AT %I* : BOOL;
END_VAR
```

In this example `main.foo.bar` has specified a placeholder hardware address. 
For the example to be considered valid, a specific address such as `%IX1.0` should have been declared.
