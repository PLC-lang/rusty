# Interface default property implementation

Properties defined in interfaces must not have an implementation. While the compiler parses them, they are not
used to validate and/or generate code and thus will have no effect. This may change in the future but as of
now is not supported.

Erreneous code example:
```iecst
INTERFACE interfaceA
    PROPERTY foo : DINT
    GET
      foo := 5; // This counts as a default implementation and hence will return a warning
    END_GET
END_PROPERTY
END_INTERFACE
```
