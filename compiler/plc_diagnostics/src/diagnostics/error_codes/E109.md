# Stateful member variable initialized with temporary reference

Stack-local variables do not yet exist at the time of initialization. Additionally, pointing to a temporary variable will lead to a dangling pointer
as soon as it goes out of scope - potential use after free.

Erroneous code example:
```iecst
FUNCTION_BLOCK foo
    VAR
        a : REF_TO BOOL := REF(b);
    END_VAR
    VAR_TEMP
        b : BOOL;
    END_VAR
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```
