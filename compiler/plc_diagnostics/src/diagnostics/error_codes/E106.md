# VAR_EXTERNAL blocks have no effect

Variables declared in a `VAR_EXTERNAL` block are currently ignored and the referenced globals will be used instead.

Example:
```
VAR_GLOBAL
    myArray : ARRAY [0..10] OF INT;
    myString: STRING;
END_VAR

FUNCTION main
VAR_EXTERNAL CONSTANT
    myArray : ARRAY [0..10] OF INT;
END_VAR
    myArray[5] := 42;
    myString := 'Hello, world!';
END_FUNCTION
```

In this example, even though `arr` is declared as `VAR_EXTERNAL CONSTANT`, the `CONSTANT` constraint will be ignored and
the global `myArray` will be mutated. The global `myString` can be read from and written to from within `main` even though it
is not declared in a `VAR_EXTERNAL` block.
