# Enum Element Initialization Must Use Assignment Operator

Enum element initialization must use the `:=` (assignment) operator, not the `=` (equality comparison) operator.

## Example

```st
// Incorrect - using = (equality operator)
TYPE State : (
    Idle := 0,
    Running = 1,  // Error: should be :=
    Stopped
);
END_TYPE

// Correct - using := (assignment operator)
TYPE State : (
    Idle := 0,
    Running := 1,
    Stopped
);
END_TYPE
```

## Note

You can mix assigned and unassigned enum elements. Unassigned elements will automatically get the next sequential value:

```st
TYPE State : (
    Idle,           // Automatically 0
    Running := 5,   // Explicitly 5
    Stopped         // Automatically 6
);
END_TYPE
```
