# E122: Invalid enum base type

This error occurs when an enum is declared with a base type that is not a valid integer type. Enums in IEC 61131-3 can only use integer types as their underlying representation.

## Example

```st
TYPE Color : STRING (red := 1, green := 2, blue := 3);
END_TYPE
```

In this example, `STRING` is not a valid base type for an enum. Only integer types are allowed.

## Another example

```st
TYPE Status : REAL (active := 1, inactive := 0);
END_TYPE

TYPE Timestamp : TIME (start := 0, stop := 1);
END_TYPE
```

These examples show other invalid base types:
- `REAL` is a floating-point type, not an integer type
- `TIME` is a time/date type, which although internally represented as an integer, should not be used as an enum base type

## Valid integer types

The following integer types are valid for enum base types:
- `INT`, `UINT` - 16-bit integers
- `SINT`, `USINT` - 8-bit integers
- `DINT`, `UDINT` - 32-bit integers
- `LINT`, `ULINT` - 64-bit integers
- `BYTE` - 8-bit unsigned
- `WORD` - 16-bit unsigned
- `DWORD` - 32-bit unsigned
- `LWORD` - 64-bit unsigned

## How to fix

**Use a valid integer type**

Change the base type to one of the supported integer types:

```st
TYPE Color : INT (red := 1, green := 2, blue := 3);
END_TYPE

TYPE Status : BYTE (active := 1, inactive := 0);
END_TYPE
```

**Or omit the type specification**

If no specific size is required, you can omit the type specification (will default to `DINT`):

```st
TYPE Color (red := 1, green := 2, blue := 3);
END_TYPE
```
