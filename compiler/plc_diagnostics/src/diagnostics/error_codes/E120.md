# `THIS` keyword is only allowed in `FUNCTION_BLOCK`

`THIS` is a keyword in IEC 61131-3 that refers to the instance of a `FUNCTION_BLOCK`. It is used to access the instance variables and methods of the `FUNCTION_BLOCK` from within its own methods.
Therefore it cannot be used in `FUNCTION`s or `PROGRAM`s, as these do not have an instance context like `FUNCTION_BLOCK`s do.

Errouneus code example:

```iec61131
FUNCTION foo
    VAR
        someVar : STRING := 'this is the instance var';
    END_VAR

    // use of `THIS` is not allowed here
    printf('%s', REF(THIS^.someVar));
END_FUNCTION
```
