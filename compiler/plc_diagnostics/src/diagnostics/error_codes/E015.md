# POINTER TO is type-unsafe

Variables defined as a `POINTER TO` data-type are considered type-unsafe in the sense that no validation will
trigger when assigning incorrect types. For example the following code, while incorrect, will not return any
diagnostics when compiling:
```
VAR
    stringVar : STRING;
    unsafePtrA : POINTER TO DINT := ADR(stringVar);
    unsafePtrB : POINTER TO DINT := REF(stringVar);
END_VAR
```

The reason for such behavior mostly stems from the fact that CodeSys behaves in that way and we want to
be compatible with CodeSys to some extent.

**For best practices, consider using `REF_TO` instead of `POINTER TO`, which is a type-safe alternative and _should_ catch
type-mismatches early on**
