# Invalid REF= assignment

For `REF=` to be valid, the left-hand side of the assignment must be a variable declared
with the `REFERENCE TO` keyword and the right hand side must be a variable of the type
that is being referenced.

For example assignments such as the following are invalid

```smalltalk
VAR
    foo     : DINT;
    bar     : DINT;
    refFoo  : REFERENCE TO DINT;
END_VAR

refFoo  REF= 5;         // `5` is not a variable
foo     REF= bar;       // `foo` is not declared with `REFERENCE TO`
refFoo  REF= refFoo;    // pointing to oneself doesn't make sense
```
