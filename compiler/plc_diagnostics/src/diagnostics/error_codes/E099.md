# Invalid `REFERENCE TO` declaration

`REFERENCE TO` variable declarations are considered valid if the referenced type is not a
* array, e.g. `foo : REFERENCE TO ARRAY[1..5] OF DINT`
* pointer, e.g. `foo : REFERENCE TO REF_TO DINT`
* reference, e.g. `foo : REFERENCE TO bar`

and furthermore are not initialized in their declaration, e.g. `foo : REFERENCE TO DINT := bar`.
