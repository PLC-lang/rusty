# Invalid `REFERENCE TO` declaration

`REFERENCE TO` variable declarations are considered valid if the referenced type is not of the following form
* `foo : REFERENCE TO REFERENCE TO (* ... *)`
* `foo : ARRAY[...] OF REFERENCE TO (* ... *)`
* `foo : REF_TO REFERENCE TO (* ... *)`

Furthermore `REFERENCE_TO` variables must not be initialized in their declaration, e.g. `foo : REFERENCE TO DINT := bar`.
