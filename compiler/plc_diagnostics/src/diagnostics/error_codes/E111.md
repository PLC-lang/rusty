# Duplicate interface methods with different signatures

POUs implementing multiple interfaces where both interfaces define a method with the same name are required
to have the same signature for the method. A method signature is thereby defined by its name, return type and
parameter list. 

Errouneus code example:
```
INTERFACE interfaceA
    METHOD foo : INT
        VAR_INPUT
            a : INT;
        END_VAR
    END_METHOD
END_INTERFACE

INTERFACE interfaceB
    METHOD foo : DINT
        VAR_OUTPUT
            a : INT;
        END_VAR
    END_METHOD
END_INTERFACE

FUNCTION_BLOCK fb IMPLEMENTS interfaceA, interfaceB
    // Signatures for foo differs, do we implement foo as defined in interfaceA or interfaceB?
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

```

In the example above, the method `foo` is defined in both interfaces `interfaceA` and `interfaceB`. 
However, the return type of `foo` in `interfaceA` is `INT` whereas in `interfaceB` it is `DINT`. Futhermore,
the parameter `a` in `interfaceA` is an input parameter whereas in `interfaceB` it is an output parameter.
As a result both you and the compiler are left in doubt as to which method signature to implement in the
function block `fb` and as a result the compiler will raise this error.
