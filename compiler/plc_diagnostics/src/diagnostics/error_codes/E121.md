# `THIS` is read-only

`THIS` is a keyword in IEC 61131-3 that refers to the instance of a `FUNCTION_BLOCK`. It is a pointer to the instance itself which doesn't change. Therefore `THIS` cannot be assigned.
Errouneus code example:

```iec61131
    FUNCTION_BLOCK foo
    END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
    FUNCTION_BLOCK bar
    VAR
        fb : foo;
    END_VAR
        this := REF(foo); // not allowed
    END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```
