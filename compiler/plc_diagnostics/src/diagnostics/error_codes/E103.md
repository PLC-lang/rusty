# Immutable Hardware Binding

Variables configured in a `VAR_CONFIG` block can not override their hardware binding.

Erroneous code example:
```
VAR_CONFIG
    main.foo.bar AT %IX1.0 : BOOL;
END_VAR

PROGRAM main
    VAR
        foo : foo_fb;
    END_VAR
END_PROGRAM

FUNCTION_BLOCK foo_fb
    VAR
        bar AT IX1.5: BOOL;
    END_VAR
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

In this example the `VAR_CONFIG` block configures `bar` to have a hardware adress `IX1.0`.
However, at the same time the `bar` inside the POU `foo_fb` assigns a hardware address `IX1.5`.

For the code to be considered valid, `bar` should have been declared as `bar AT %I* : BOOL`.
