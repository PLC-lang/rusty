# Invalid use of the `SUPER` keyword

The `SUPER` keyword provides access to members of a parent POU (Program Organization Unit) in an inheritance hierarchy. However, there are several rules governing its proper use:

## Common errors

1. **Using `SUPER` in a POU that doesn't extend another POU**:  
   The `SUPER` keyword can only be used inside a POU that directly extends another POU through the `EXTENDS` keyword.

2. **Not dereferencing `SUPER` to access members**:  
   When accessing members of a superclass, `SUPER` must be dereferenced using the `^` operator: `SUPER^.member`.

3. **Chaining `SUPER` references**:  
   `SUPER` cannot be accessed as a member of another object. Expressions like `SUPER^.SUPER^` are invalid.

4. **Global access position**:  
   `SUPER` cannot be used with the global access operator (`.SUPER^.member`).

5. **Using `SUPER` with type cast operators**:  
   The type cast operator (`<type>#`) cannot be used with `SUPER`.

## Examples of invalid use

```iecst
// Error: Using SUPER in a POU that doesn't extend another POU
FUNCTION_BLOCK fb
    SUPER^.x := 2;  // Error: Invalid use of `SUPER`
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

// Error: Not dereferencing SUPER when accessing members
FUNCTION_BLOCK child EXTENDS parent
    SUPER.x := 20;  // Error: `SUPER` must be dereferenced to access its members
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

// Error: Chaining SUPER references/SUPER in member access
FUNCTION_BLOCK child EXTENDS parent
    x.SUPER^.y := 20;    
    SUPER^.SUPER^.x := 20;  
    // Error: `SUPER` is not allowed in member-access position
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

// Error: Global access position
FUNCTION_BLOCK child EXTENDS parent
    .SUPER^.x := 20;  // Error: `SUPER` is not allowed in global-access position
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

// Error: Using SUPER with type cast
FUNCTION_BLOCK child EXTENDS parent
    p := parent#SUPER;  // Error: The `<type>#` operator cannot be used with `SUPER`
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
