# Template variable does not exist

A variable was configured in a `VAR_CONFIG` block, but the variable can not be found in the code.

Erroneous code example:
```iecst
VAR_CONFIG
    main.foo.bar AT %IX1.0 : BOOL;
END_VAR

PROGRAM main
    VAR
        foo : foo_fb;
    END_VAR
END_PROGRAM

FUNCTION_BLOCK foo_fb
    VAR
        qux AT %I* : BOOL;
    END_VAR
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

In this example a variable named `bar` is configured, however the function block `foo_fb` does not contain
a `bar` variable. The could should have been `main.foo.qux AT %IX1.0 : BOOL` instead for it to be valid.
