# Interface default method implementation

Methods defined in interfaces must not have an implementation. While the compiler parses them, they are not
used to validate and/or generate code and thus will have no effect. This may change in the future but as of 
now is not supported.

Erreneous code example:
```
INTERFACE interfaceA
    METHOD methodA : INT
        methodA := 5; // This counts as a default implementation and hence will return a warning
    END_METHOD
END_INTERFACE
```
