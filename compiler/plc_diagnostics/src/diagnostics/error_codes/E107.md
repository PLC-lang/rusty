# Missing configuration for template variable

A template variable was left unconfigured.

Erroneous code example:
```
VAR_CONFIG
    main.foo.bar AT %IX1.0 : BOOL;
END_VAR

PROGRAM main
    VAR
        foo : foo_fb;
    END_VAR
END_PROGRAM

FUNCTION_BLOCK foo_fb
    VAR
        bar AT %I* : BOOL;
        qux AT %I* : BOOL;
    END_VAR
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

In this example a variable named `main.foo.qux` is declared as a template, however the `VAR_CONFIG`-block does not contain
an address-configuration for it. Each template variable needs to be configured, otherwise it could lead to segmentation faults at runtime.
