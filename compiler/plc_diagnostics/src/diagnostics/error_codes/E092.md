# Equivalent enum value used

This message indicates that the assigned enum value is not part of the enum,
but is equivalent to one of the internal values of the enum.

Example:
```iecst
TYPE Colors : (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) END_TYPE
TYPE Directions : (N, S, W, E) END_TYPE

VAR_GLOBAL
    col : Colors := N; //N is equivalent to Red but is not part of the enum
    dir : Directions := Red; //Red is equivalent to N but is not part of the enum
END_VAR
```

To solve the issue, use the equivalent value indicated by the enum
