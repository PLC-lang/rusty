# Template variable is configured multiple times

A template variable is configured more than once, leading to ambiguity.

Erroneous code example:
```iecst
VAR_CONFIG
    main.foo.bar AT %IX1.0 : BOOL;
    main.foo.bar AT %IX1.1 : BOOL;
END_VAR

PROGRAM main
    VAR
        foo : foo_fb;
    END_VAR
END_PROGRAM

FUNCTION_BLOCK foo_fb
    VAR
        bar AT %I* : BOOL;
    END_VAR
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

In this example a variable named `main.foo.bar` has multiple configurations in the `VAR_CONFIG`-block. It is not clear which address this variable should map to - only a single configuration entry per instance-variable is allowed.
