# Template variable without hardware binding

A template variable must contain a hardware binding.


Erroneous code example:
```
VAR_CONFIG
    main.foo.bar AT %IX1.0 : BOOL;
END_VAR

PROGRAM main
    VAR
        foo : foo_fb;
    END_VAR
END_PROGRAM

FUNCTION_BLOCK foo_fb
    VAR
        bar : BOOL;
    END_VAR
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

In this example the `VAR_CONFIG` block declares the `bar` variable inside `foo_fb` as a
template variable. However `bar` does not have a hardware binding. For the example to be
considered valid, `bar` should have been declared as e.g. `bar AT %I* : BOOL`.
