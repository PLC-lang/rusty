# PLC Rowan Parser

## Acknowledgments

This implementation is taken and adapted from the excellent [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer) parser implementation. The parsing infrastructure has been thoroughly refined through years of development and testing.

We are grateful for the insights provided by the article [Resilient LL Parsing Tutorial](https://matklad.github.io/2023/05/21/resilient-ll-parsing-tutorial.html), which provided valuable guidance on resilient parsing techniques.

Special thanks to **Alex Kladov** and the other developers from the **rust-analyzer team** (Ferrous Systems) for their outstanding work and for maintaining such an exemplary open-source project that serves as an inspiration for compiler and language tool development.
