# Pre-commit is currently in testing phase for this repo. It is not yet forced
# in CI or mandatory to use. Pre-commit will run various checks and mostly fix
# those when you do commiting. You can use it locally by installing it with
#
#  pip install pre-commit
#
# and running
#
#  pre-commit install
#
# in the root of the repository. This will install git hook which will run
# checks before every commit. If you want to run checks manually for whole repo,
# you can run
#
#  pre-commit run --all-files
#
# You can always commit without running checks by adding --no-verify flag to git
# commit command.
